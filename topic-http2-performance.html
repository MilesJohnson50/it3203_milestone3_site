  <h1>HTTP/2 Performance Characteristics</h1>
  <p>
    HTTP/2 keeps the same high‑level semantics as HTTP/1.1 but changes how messages are framed and
    transported. The goal is to reduce latency and improve page load performance, especially on high‑latency
    or lossy networks.
  </p>

  <h2>Binary Framing and Streams</h2>
  <p>
    HTTP/2 uses a binary framing layer that divides communication into independent <em>streams</em>. Each
    stream carries frames belonging to a single logical request/response pair. All streams share one TCP
    connection between client and origin.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Streams</strong> — bidirectional channels identified by stream IDs.</li>
    <li><strong>Frames</strong> — smallest unit of communication (HEADERS, DATA, SETTINGS, and so on).</li>
    <li><strong>Multiplexing</strong> — interleaving frames from many streams on a single connection.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Multiplexing vs. Head‑of‑Line Blocking</h2>
  <p>
    Multiplexing allows a browser to fetch many resources in parallel without opening multiple TCP
    connections. However, because everything still sits on top of a single TCP connection, a lost TCP
    packet can delay frames from <em>all</em> streams until that packet is retransmitted. This residual
    head‑of‑line blocking is one motivation for HTTP/3.
  </p>

  <h2>Header Compression (HPACK)</h2>
  <p>
    HTTP/2 introduces HPACK, a compression mechanism that reduces the size of HTTP headers.
    Smaller headers matter because modern pages often make dozens of requests and repeat common header
    fields (such as cookies and user agents).
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uses static and dynamic tables of header fields.</li>
    <li>Encodes header names and values as indexes when possible.</li>
    <li>Reduces bandwidth and can improve page load times on slow networks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Prioritization and Server Push</h2>
  <p>
    Clients can assign relative priorities to streams, hinting which resources should be sent first.
    HTTP/2 also defined server push, allowing servers to send related resources proactively. In practice,
    server push has seen limited use and is being removed from many implementations as HTTP/3 becomes
    the focus.
